# Joyride
 Project for CSE-201
USER DOCUMENTATION

GETTING STARTED:
Welcome to the JoyRide Application, in this document you will find out more information on how to use our application to its full potential. The primary goal of our application is to make buying and selling cars a more fluid and enjoyable experience. With our application a user will be able to log in and then see a library of cars that contain user ratings and then be able to make purchases. A helpful feature that we are including with our project is the ability to filter through different vehicle types and the ability to filter by rating as well. Being able to see the different ratingws will make the user more able to find a car that is enjoyable for their rental.
