USER DOCUMENTATION

## Introduction
Welcome to the JoyRide Application, in this document you will find out more information on how to use our application to its full potential. The primary goal of our application
is to make buying and selling cars a more fluid and enjoyable experience. With our application a user will be able to log in and then see a library of cars that contain user
ratings and then be able to make purchases. A helpful feature that we are including with our project is the ability to filter through different vehicle types and the ability to
filter by rating as well. Being able to see the different ratings will make the user more able to find a car that is enjoyable for their rental. 

## Setup
There is no necessary downloads when trying to use Joyride. We wanted to create an application that is easy to use and makes the car rental experience more of a positive experience.  Joyride is accessible through a web browser, as well as being accessible on both IOS and Andriod. Joyride is accessible
for both guests, as well as registered users who sign up with an email and password. Joyride also has verification statuses for moderators and admins.
